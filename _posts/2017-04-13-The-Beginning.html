	Today, April 13th, 2017, marks the day that my "first" official website has started. I have made other websites that weren't good and were made from templates. This website was custom made by me, Dylan Plemmons. Sorry if it sounded like I was "tooting my own horn" there but I'm very excited for what I have accomplished. <br><br>
	So, what is this website basically? It is a technology website that will have posts for new gadgets, game reviews and game information, and security flaw exposures. I've always have had a love for technology because it is just so interesting and it would be awesome to have a life to just writing about and reviewing technology. <br><br> Now, this is where everything begins, with a technology news site with only one author (that is terrible at writing) and a big dream. Hopefully this will start a lot of new things in my life because I have a lot of plans on expanding this news site to be much more. <br><br> 
	Glad to see you come along this trip and I hope to see you like the things I will be writing! :D
